This is it. The moment we’ve all been waiting for. GEO earnings tomorrow. Also CRSR earnings, but GEO is the play that will bring me to the stars. But I can’t let my pride get hold of me. If earnings suck, and the play turns out to suck, I will unload so I don’t take a hit. I will not hold on if things start to go south like I mistakenly held on to the others.

Market was quiet today, SPY ended up plus 1%. GEO was down ~2% most of the day, there was some news that they had to pay a settlement of 3 million to pay back investors over something I don’t quite recall. But that’s a nothingburger. Stock finished down 1% and then was up to 9.11 in after hours.

But there are 3 things that could occur tomorrow. One, which is the one I hope, is that earnings are spectacular and the stock moons. The other, is that earnings really aren’t a significant swing one way or another and it stays level. The other is the earnings disappoint and it crashes. Either way, I will keep my eye on this stock throughout the day tomorrow because I have invested a significant amount of capital on this one stock and I will depend on it to make me a good amount of income, in addition to my regular job. On the morrow.
