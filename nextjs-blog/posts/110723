It happened. GEO went on a run. 5.53% gain in a single day. Ironically, it didn’t even beat earnings. Earnings came in as expected at 0.19 cents a share. Revenue of 602 million beat 595 million estimate. The bad part was it lowered Q4 revenue outlook from $595M-$610M to $590M-$600M. Not a bad thing, only comes down to a few cents a share. So right now it’s trading at about 8-9 forward P/E and the industry average is 11.94 forward P/E. I still think it’s undervalued. Target price of 11, but I’ll hold until 12 if it goes on a bull run due to overoptimism. We will see how this one pans out, my gut feeling is we will see a pullback tomorrow of about 20 cents, then a further increase to 10 within the next week and a half.
