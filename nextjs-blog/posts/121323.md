Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady today. They decided to lower rates by probably 1% in 2024. Markets mooned. SPY is at all time high at $470.50. Lots of green days are ahead.
My portfolio actually isn’t all that impressive at +46.38% YTD because GEO had a rough month and is only up 39%. It may have saturated and reached a plateau because it is at 12.17 FWD PE ratio which is about industry average. I’m still going to keep the bulk of my capital in that stock because I think it has more upside what with political action against the migrant crisis upcoming and also Corecivic at 26X PE ratio and generally I don’t think it’s reach all time highs. Maybe I’m just too lazy to move my capital into another stock IDK. I also don’t want to realize the gains because it is almost year end and I don’t want to foot that tax bill. That’s a good 1-2 thousand dollar difference in taxes on whether I don’t realize the gains. We’ll see. I don’t think it’s going back down to lows anytime soon.
