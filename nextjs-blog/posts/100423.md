Market’s down big lately. My GEO is already down to $8.09. Market was actually up today trading on pessimistic job news. Job hirings slowed down a lot in September and people are taking that as a good sign because it is a sign economy is slowing down enough for rates to be lowered.
NIO and CRSR were up decent today.

On a surprising note, LVLU was up %14.29 today to $2.32. I was right to hold on to those shares and I’ll probably get rid of them at the end of the year to take on the $9,000 in deferred losses because it really is a worthless security. No chance of growth, might be bankrupt in a  few years time.

But we will get through this. CPI coming up next week so we’ll see what that is. Holding on to my GEO shares obviously because that value play will make me $42,000. If 10-year yields keep going up we should be in for some rough patches ahead but I’m not selling anything in my portfolio I will just hold for eternity.
I want to get this up in blog format but I can’t afford the blog subscription and domain name.
Once I finish this react course I’ll put this in blog format, buy a domain and let my posts rip.
I also want to use that react course to set up a site to monitor day to day changes in my portfolio’s stock prices.
