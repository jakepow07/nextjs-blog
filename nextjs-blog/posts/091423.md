This market is causing a lot of divisive opinions. As of September 14th, 2023 the S&P 500 went up 0.84% to 4,505.10. Still below the 4,711.19 high of late 2021 but still quite bullish nonetheless.

Some say that in any bull market when everyone is greedy, and have lost all fear of a drop then that is when the end is near. The market is ruled by emotions, after all.

But any legitimate macroeconomic analysis has to take into account data. Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis dictates that consumer spending is at all time highs, clocking in at 0.8% in July. This negates any hints of a recession, but this could change due to the resumption of student loan payments. The headline for all of 2022 and half of 2023 was inflation. Is the CPI at 3.6% a healthy number? It certainly isnâ€™t close to the 2% target. And will the Fed raise interest rates again? Experts claim that is unlikely to happen at the September meeting, but is a very valid concern in November. 

It is of my opinion that the strongest correlation of whether the market will rise or drop in the coming months is the actions of the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell. As soon as interest rates are cut, the bull market may be a sure thing. But that is never going to happen for the rest of 2023 and possibly all of 2024. Powell has been considerably hawkish in his comments on Fed policy in the last few months.

Overall, I expect the bull market to continue in the coming months as there is no hint of a recession in the near future and the Fed may pause hiking rates if inflation data continues to lower.
