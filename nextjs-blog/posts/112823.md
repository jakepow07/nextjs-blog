My portfolio has performed fantastic in the last month. It is up 11% in the last month and is now up 46.57% YTD. It started with encouraging CPI results on November 15th, with inflation coming in at 3.2% YoY. The market mooned on that news, and additionally the other main part of my success has been outstanding performance by my main holding, GEO. It is now up 42.13% since when I bought it, netting me $7,700 in gains. I sold off some of it to finance credit card debt payments over the coming holiday season, but I only sold 415 of my original 2,386 shares so my position is still substantial. I’m now a little worried about my exposure to risk because even a day’s loss of 4-5% can lose me a lot in a single day. I thought about slowly selling off  over the next month but I have decided what I have to gain still far outweighs what I can lose. It is still a good value play even at this price. Well, it may not be a great value anymore, but it may have some good momentum to the upside especially if legislation passes favoring migrant monitoring.
