Brutal day on Friday. My portfolio went down 3.76% in a single day. The Fed is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The market has priced in that rates will remain steady, and it has priced in a 20% chance of a rate raise in December. I think at this point Powell achieved his goal of a soft landing. Earnings came in the past week and weren’t a total disaster as most were expecting. Amazon and Meta and other Big Tech mostly beat expectations. Exxon and other energy disappointed.

Earnings were mixed but I don’t think it will lead Powell to raise rates. Because inflation is down to a sufficient level (September CPI came in at 3.7%) he is mostly on target for his soft landing. It will take at least a year to get inflation down to 2%, probably more and it would have happened more quickly had the Fed been more aggressive in its rate hikes.

On a micro scale, I am particularly interested in the stocks that I own and their respective earnings in the next two weeks. NWL already came in last Friday, it disappointed at a net loss of 0.52 cents a share. It’s not that bad though, because I looked at the cash flow statement and it looked pretty good at $679 million.

GEO and CRSR report on 11/7, LVLU and UWMC report on 11/8, NIO on 11/9. So the Fed will announce its decision a week before these earnings calls which I feel will have a big impact on these stock prices and the entire market before their respective earnings calls.
